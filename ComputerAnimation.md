# Story development

- The writer has to focus to adapt the strengths and defects of visual media

- The script is broken down into a sequence of shots and tracks before the storyboard is created.

## Visual development

- setting a visual direction and style for a project.
- It includes character creation, env types and properties, the general style, atmosphere and look and color schemes for the projects
- Creating color pallettes and color keys for each scene in the project is an important aspect of the visual dev process that will set much of the visual mood for the project.

- The color keys must visually complement the goals of much of the story

## Character Design

- The characters are the second most important aspects of an animated project after the story.
- The look of characters is developed through drawings, paintings, and even computer generated renderings.

## Storyboard

- This is the first attempt to translate the story and script into a visual form/images.
- It breaks down the script into manageable visual sequences and it is used to do technical breakdown for each shot

## Screenplay to Storyboard

- A screenplay is a written document that tells the story by using descriptions, dialogue, and some production notes,
- It is an intermediate work that enables the story to be retold with images in the form of an animation, a movie, or a show.
- They tell stories in ways that can be translated into moving images.
- One screenplay page is equal to one minute of screen time, they are converted into storyboards as they are readied for visual production.
- A storyboard is a visual representation of the screenplay, it is a series of images and production notes, it consists of a series of panels that contain the visual form of the scenes and shots specified in the screenplay.
- The storyboards are usually drawn on boards, paper or pre printed paper with guides

## Animatics and Pre-visualization

- An animatic is a preliminary version or a rough cut of a computer animation and is used to visualize how the final project may be structured.
- They are based on preliminary visual materials ie low resolutions motion tests, none of the special effects are meant to be final, therefore they are implemented with less expensive and less time consuming techniques.

## Scene Layout

- The positions and motions of the characters and the camera are blocked out in the scene layout.

## Modeling

- Spatial descriptions and placement of imaginary objects and characters and scenes with a computer program.

## Animation Controls

- This are internal skeletons that are often used to animate characters and objects in a computer animation.

## Live data capture

- Relies heavily from getting data from live action sets, remote its a remote location or a sound stage
- Most live data capture requires special equipment and software specifically designed for motion capture.

## Character animation

- It begins with rough animation and ends with animation cleanup.
- The broad motions are usually brought in first, proxies or placeholder geometry are generally used to do this.
- The secondary actions and facial animations are added next and finally the details re cleaned up and timing of overlapping motions are adjusted.

## Effects Animation

- Usually includes natural phenomena like fire, water, smoke, wind and water in its many forms ie rain, snow, and ice, etc. as well as special
