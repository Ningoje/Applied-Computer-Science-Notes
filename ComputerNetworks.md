# Computer Networks

## Attack
 A deliberate attempt to compromise integrity, or availability of a computer system or network by exploiting weaknesses in design, implementation, or configuration.

Attacks can be classified as passive or active.

### Passive Attack
They attempt to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. It includes:

- Eavesdropping message content or sniffing
- Traffic analysis

Such attacks are difficult to detect therefore the strategy is to prevent the attack.

### Active Attack
They attempt to alter system resources, or affect their operation. They include:

- Spoofing, ie. masquerading or impersonation
- Replay
- Modification, ie. altering the message, man in the middle
- DOS ,etc.

They are easier to detect but more difficult to prevent.

## Terms
**Vulnerability** is a weakness in a security system.

**Threat** is a set of circumstances that has potential to cause loss or harm.

**Controls** are ways to block a threat that tries to exploit one or more vulnerabilities.

## Security Objectives

1. **Confidentiality** - aims to protect data against unauthorized disclosure.
2. **Integrity** - aims to detect unauthorized data modification and replay.
3. **Availability** - ensures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.

## Impacts of Security Attacks

An attack on a business can lead to:

- Economic/Financial losses
- Reputation damage
- Legal consequences
